Have you ever wondered how the **shipwrecks** in vanilla Minecraft would look in their prime? Wonder no longer, for this datapack adds shipwrecks repaired and sailing again, naturally generating in your world! They come with few changes (e.g. sails and lanterns), and only come in their vanilla design.

![ship icon plus](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/b59f96da454110fd304e473ccbdac08c77be8147.png) **Unwrecked Ships Plus** adds _every_ combination of wood-type and sail color in the game, as well as Nether ships that use Nether-only woods. In addition, some ships can have sailors, such as Villagers, Pillagers, and Piglins for the Nether ships. These ships also vary from vanilla in loot layout.
